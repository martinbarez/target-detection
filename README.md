# target_detection
A simulation of FPGA arithmetics done in Python 3 for [my thesis on Target detection of hyperspectral imagery on FPGAs](https://eprints.ucm.es/id/eprint/62874/). There are also some plots that appear on the thesis.

I initially created this repository to track changes locally, so it may not be as clean as it should be. It still contains all files, licensed under MIT, in case anyone finds them usefull. 

There are three repositories that make up my thesis:

 1. [target_vhdl](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_vhdl) for the VHDL source code
 2. [target-detection](https://github.com/martinbarez/target-detection) the python simulation and plotting I used (this one)
 3. [target_tex](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_tex) the LaTeX files for the thesis (may be private)
